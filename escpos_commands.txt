[Description]   Moves the print position to the next horizontal tab position. 
[Details]   •  This command is ignored unless the next horizontal tab position has been set. 
                •  If the next horizontal tab position exceeds the printing area, the printer sets the printing position to [Printing area  
width + 1]. 
                •  Horizontal tab positions are set with ESC D. 
                •  If this command is received when the printing position is at [printing area width + 1], the printer executes print buffer-
full printing of the current line and horizontal tab processing from the beginning of the next line. 
                •  The default setting of the horizontal tab position for the paper roll is font A (12 × 24) every 8th character (9th, 17th,

                 Hex             10           04         n 
                 Decimal      16            4          n 
[Range] 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 
[Description] Transmits the selected printer status specified by n in real-time, according to the following parameters: 
                      n = 1: Transmit printer status 
                      n = 2: Transmit off-line status 
                      n = 3: Transmit error status 
                      n = 4: Transmit paper roll sensor status
[Details] • The status is transmitted whenever the data sequence of <10>H<04>H< n> (1 ≤ n ≤ 4) is received. 
                 Example: 
                 In ESC ∗ m nL nH d1...dk, d1=<10>H, d2=<04>H, d3=<01>H 
              • This command should not be used within the data sequence of another command that consists of 2 or more bytes. 
                 Example: 
                 If you attempt to transmit ESC 3 n to the printer, but DTR (DSR for the host computer) goes to MARK before n is trans-  
   mitted andthen DLE EOT 3 interrupts before n is received, the code <10>H for DLE EOT 3 is processed as the code for 
   ESC 3 <10>H.

• 
• The printer transmits the current status. Each status is represented by onebyte data. 
• The printer transmits the status without confirming whether the host computer can receive data. 
• The printer executes this command upon receiving it. 
• This command is executed even when the printer is off-line, the receive buffer is full, or there is an error status with a 
serial  interface model. 
• With a parallel interface model, this command can not be executed when the printer is busy. This command is executed 
even when the printer is off-line or there is an error status when DIP switch 2-1 is on with a parallel interface model. 
• When Auto Status Back (ASB) is enabled using the GS a command, the status transmitted by the DLE EOT command 
and the ASB status must be differentiated.  
Even though the printer is not selected using ESC = (select peripheral device), this command is effective.

[Range] 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 
[Description] Responds to a request from the host computer. n specifies the requests as follows:
[Details]
 
[Reference] DLE EOT
• This command is effective only when an auto-cutter error occurs. 
• The printer starts processing data upon receiving this command. 
• This command is executed even when the printer is off-line, the receive buffer is full, or there is an error status with a  
  serial interface model. 
• With a parallel interface model, this command can not be executed when the printer is busy. This command is executed 
  even when the printer is off-line or there is an error status when DIP switch 2-1 is on with a parallel interface model. 
• The status is also transmitted whenever the data sequence of <10>H<05>H< n> (1 ≤ n ≤ 2) is received. 
  Example: 
  In ESC * m nL nH dk, d1 = <10>H, d2 = <05>H, d3 = <01>H 
• This command should not be contained within another command that consists of two or more bytes. Example: If you  
  attempt to transmit ESC 3 n to the printer, but DTR (DSR for the host computer) goes to MARK before n is transmitted, 
  and DLE ENQ 2 interrupts before n is received, the code <10>H for DLE ENQ 2 is processed as the code for ESC 3 
  <10>H. 
• DLE ENQ 2 enables the printer to recover from an error after clearing the data in the receive buffer and the print buffer. 
  The printer retains the settings (by ESC !, ESC 3, etc.) that were in effect when the error occurred. The printer can be 
  initialized completely by using this command and ESC @. This command is enabled only for errors that have the 
  possib-ility of recovery, except for print head temperature error. 
• When the printer is disabled with ESC = (Select peripheral device), the error recovery functions (DLE ENQ 1 and DLE 
  ENQ 2) are enabled, and the other functions are disabled.

--- Page 6 ---
              pulse ON time is [ t × 100 ms] and the OFF time is [ t × 100ms]. 
[Details] • When the printer is in an error status when this command is processed, this command is ignored. 
              • When the pulse is output to the connector pin specified while ESC p or DEL DC4 is executed while this command is pr-
ocessed, this command is ignored. 
              • The printer executes this command upon receiving it. 
              • With a serial interface model, this command is executed even when the printer is off-line, the receive buffer is full, or 
there is an error status. 
              • With a parallel interface model, this command cannot be executed when the printer is busy. This command is executed 
even when the printer is off-line or there is an error status when DIP switch 2-1 is on. 
              • If print data includes the same character strings as this command, the printer performs the same operation specified by 
this command. The user must consider this. 
              • This command should not be used within the data sequence of another command that consists of 2 or more bytes. 
              • This command is effective even when the printer is disabled with ESC = (Select peripheral device).

[Range] 0 ≤ n ≤ 255 
[Description] Sets the character spacing for the right side of the character to [ n horizontal or vertical motion units].  
[Details] •The right-side character spacing for double-width mode is twice the normal value. When characters are enlarged, the 
right-side character spacing is n times normal value.
              • This command does not affect the setting of kanji characters. 
              • This command sets values independently in each mode (standard and page modes). 
           • The horizontal and vertical motion unit are specified by GS P. Changing the horizontal or vertical motion unit does not 
affect the current right-side spacing. 
           • The GS P command can change the horizontal (and vertical) motion unit. However, the value cannot be less than the 
minimum horizontal movement amount, and it must be in even units of the minimum horizontal movement amount. 
              • In standard mode, the horizontal motion unit is used. 
             • In page mode, the horizontal or vertical motion unit differs in page mode, depending on starting position of the printable 
area as follows: 
             1 When the starting position is set to the upper left or lower right of the printable area using ESC T, the horizontal motion 
unit ( x) is used. 
            2 When the starting position is set to the upper right or lower left of the printable area using ESC T, the vertical motion 
unit ( y) is used. 
            • The maximum right-side spacing is 255/180 inches. Any setting exceeding the maximum is converted to the maximum 
automatically.

[Description] Selects print mode(s) using n as follows:
[Details] • When both double-height and double-width modes are selected, quadruple size characters are printed. 
              • The printer can underline all characters, but can not underline the space set by HT or 90° clockwise rotated characters. 
              • The thickness of the underline is that selected by ESC , regardless of the character size. 
              • When some characters in a line are double or more height, all the characters on the line are aligned at the baseline. 
              • ESC E can also turn on or off emphasized mode. However, the setting of the last received command is effective. 
              • ESC —can also turn on or off underline mode. However, the setting of the last received command is effective. 
              • GS ! can also select character size. However, the setting of the last received command is effective. 
             • Emphasized mode is effective for alphanumeric and Kanji. All print modes except emphasized mode is effective only for

[Description] •  Defines user-defined characters. 
                     •  y specifies the number of bytes in the vertical direction. 
                     •  c1 specifies the beginning character code for the definition, and c2 specifies the final code. 
                     •  x specifies the number of dots in the horizontal direction. 
[Details] •  The allowable character code range is from ASCII code <20>H to <7E>H (96 characters). 
              •  It is possible to define multiple characters for consecutive character codes. If only one character is desired, use c1 = c2. 
              •  d is the dot data for the characters. The dot pattern is in the horizontal direction from the left side. Any remaining dots 
                 on the right side are blank. 
              •  The data to define a user-defined character is (y×x) bytes. 
              •  Set a corresponding bit to 1 to print a dot or 0 to not print a dot. 
              •  This command can define different user-defined character patterns by each fonts. To select a font, use ESC ! 
              • A user-defined character and a downloaded bit image cannot be defined simultaneously. When this command is 
                executed, the downloaded bit image is cleared. 
              •  The user-defined character definition is cleared when: 
                 ① ESC @ is executed. 
                 ② ESC ? is executed. 
                 ③ FS q is executed. 
                 ④ GS *is executed. 
                 ⑤ The printer is reset or the power is turned off. 
              •  When the user-defined characters are defined in font B (9×17), only the most significant bit of the 3rd byte of data in 
                 vertical direction is effective.

[Description] Selects a bit-image mode using m for the number of dots specified by nL and nH, as follows:
[Details] •  If the values of m is out of the specified range, nL and data following are processed as normal data. 
              •  The nL and nH indicate the number of dots of the bit image in the horizontal direction. The number of dots is calculated 
by nL + nH ×256. 
              •  If the bit-image data input exceeds the number of dots to be printed on a line, the excess data is ignored.
              •  d indicates the bit-image data. Set a corresponding bit to 1 to print a dot or to 0 to not print a dot. 
              •  If the width of the printing area set by GS L and GS W less than the width required by the data sent with the ESC *  
command, the following will be performed on the line in question (but the printing cannot exceed the maximum
printable area): 
              ① The width of the printing area is extended to the right to accommodate the amount of data. 
              ② If step ① does not provide sufficient width for the data, the left margin is reduced to accommodate the data. 
              •  After printing a bit image, the printer returns to normal data processing mode. 
              •  This command is not affected by print modes (emphasized, double-strike, underline, character size or white/black 
reverse printing), except upside-down printing mode. 
              •  The relationship between the image data and the dots to be printed is as follows:

[Range] 0 ≤ n ≤ 255 
[Description] Sets the line spacing to [ n ×vertical or horizontal motion unit] inches. 
[Details] •  The line spacing can be set independently in standard mode and in page mode. 
              •  The horizontal and vertical motion unit are specified by GS P. Changing the horizontal or vertical motion unit does not 
affect the current line spacing. 
              •  The GS P command can change the horizontal (and vertical) motion unit. However, the value cannot be less than the 
minimum vertical movement amount, and it must be in even units of the minimum vertical movement amount. 
              • In standard mode, the vertical motion unit (y) is used. 
              • In page mode, this command functions as follows, depending on the starting position of the printable area: 
              ① When the starting position is set to the upper left or lower right of the printable area using ESC T, the vertical moti-
on unit (y) is used. 
              ② When the starting position is set to the upper right or lower left of the print able area using ESC T, the horizontal 
motion unit ( x) is used. 
              • The maximum paper feed amount is 1016 mm (40 inches). Even if a paper feed amount of more than 1016 mm (40 
inches) is set, the printer feeds the paper only 1016 mm (40 inches). 
[Default] Line spacing equivalent to approximately 4.23mm (1/6 inches).

             • k indicates the total number of horizontal tab positions to be set. 
[Details] • The horizontal tab position is stored as a value of [character width ×n] measured from the beginning of the line. The 
character width includes the right-side character spacing, and double-width characters are set with twice the width of
 normal characters. 
        • This command cancels the previous horizontal tab settings. 
        • When setting n = 8, the print position is moved to column 9 by sending HT. 
        •  Up to 32 tab positions ( k = 32) can be set. Data exceeding 32 tab positions is processed as normal data. 
        •  Transmit [ n] k in ascending order and place a NUL code 0 at the end. 
        • When [ n] k is less than or equal to the preceding value [ n] k-1, tab setting is finished and the following data is 
processed as normal data. 
        • ESC D NUL cancels all horizontal tab positions. 
        • The previously specified horizontal tab positions do not change, even if the character width changes. 
        • The character width is memorized for each standard and page mode. 
[Default] The default tab positions are at intervals of 8 characters (columns 9, 17, 25,...) for font A (12 ×24).

[Description] • The horizontal starting position, vertical starting position, printing area width, and printing area height are defined 
                       as x0, y0, dx (inch), dy (inch), respectively. Each setting for the printing area is calculated as follows: 
                       x0 = [( xL + xH × 256) × (horizontal motion unit)] 
                       y0 = [( yL + yH × 256) × (vertical motion unit)] 
                       dx = [ dxL + dxH × 256] × (horizontal motion unit)] 
                       dy = [ dyL + dyH × 256] × (vertical motion unit)] 
                      The printing area is set as shown in the figure below. 
[Details] • If this command is input in standard mode, the printer executes only internal flag operation. This command does not 
affect printing in standard mode. 
              • If the horizontal or vertical starting position is set outside the printable area, the printer stops command processing and 
processes the following data as normal data. 
              • If the printing area width or height is set to 0, the printer stops command processing and processes the following data 
as normal data. 
              • This command sets the position where data is buffered to the position specified by ESC T within the printing area. 
              • If (horizontal starting position + printing area width) exceeds the printable area, the printing area width is automatically 
set to (horizontal printable area - horizontal starting position). 
              • If (vertical starting position + printing area height) exceeds the printable area,  the printing area height is automatically

              • The horizontal and vertical motion unit are specified by GS P. Changing the horizontal or vertical motion unit does not 
affect the current printing area. 
              • The GS P command can change the horizontal (and vertical) motion unit. 
                 However, the value cannot be less than the minimum horizontal movement amount, and it must be in even units of 
minimum hori-zontal movement amount. 
              • Use the horizontal motion unit ( x) for setting the horizontal starting position and printing area width, and use the 
vertical motion unit ( y) for setting the vertical starting position and printing area height. 
              • When the horizontal starting position , vertical starting position, printing area width, and printing area height are defined 
as X, Y, Dx, and Dy respectively, the printing area is set as shown in the figure below.
              • This printable area for this printer is approximately 72 mm in the horizontal direction and approximately 117.3 mm 
(1662/360 inches) in the vertical direction.

              • In standard mode, the horizontal motion unit is used. 
             • In page mode, the horizontal or vertical motion unit differs as follows, depending on the starting point of the printing area: 
             ①When the starting position is set to the upper left or lower right of the printable area using ESC T, the horizontal motion 
                unit ( x) is used. 
             ②When the starting position is set to the upper right or lower left of the printable area using ESC T, the vertical motion 
                unit ( y) is used.

[Description] Prints a NV bit image n using the mode specified by m.
                    [dpi: dots per 25.4 mm {1"}] 
              • n is the number of the NV bit image (defined using the FS q command). 
              • m specifies the bit image mode. 
[Details] • NV bit image means a bit image which is defined in a non-volatile memory by FS q and printed by FS p. 
              • This command is not effective when the specified NV bit image has not been defined. 
              • In standard mode, this command is effective only when there is no data in the print buffer. 
              • In page mode, this command is not effective. 
              • This command is not affected by print modes (emphasized, double-strike, underline, character size, white/black reve-
rse printing, or 90° rotated characters, etc.), except upside-down printing mode. 
              • If the printing area width set by GS L and GS W for the NV bit image is less than one vertical line, the following rocess-
ing is performed only on the line in question. However, in NV bit image mode, one vertical line means 1 dot in normal 
mode (m=0, 48) and in double-height mode (m=2, 50), and it means 2 dots in double-width mode (m=1, 49) and in 
quadruple mode(m=3, 51). 
              ①The printing area width is extended to the right in NV bit image mode up to one line vertically. In this case, printing 
does not exceed the printable area. 
             ②If the printing area width cannot be extended by one line vertically, the left margin is reduced to accommodate one

              Total defined data area = 0.5M bits (64K bytes) [Description] Define the NV bit image specified by n . 
              • n specifies the number of the defined NV bit image. 
              • xL, xH specifies (xL + xH×256) × 8 dots in the horizontal direction for the NV bit image you are defining. 
              • yL, yH specifies (yL + yH ╳ 256) ╳  8 dots in the vertical direction for the NV bit image you are defining. 
[Details] • This command cancels all NV bit images that have already been defined by this command. The printer can not redefine 
only one of several data definitions previously defined. In this case, all data needs to be sent again. 
              • From the beginning of the processing of this command till the finish of hardware reset, mechanical operations (includ-
ing initializing the position of the printer head when the cover is open, paper feeding by using the FEED button, etc.) 
cannot be performed. 
              • During processing this command, the printer is in BUSY when writing the data to the NV user memory and stops 
receiving data. Therefore it is prohibitted to transmit the data including the real-time commands during the execution of
 this c  o  m   m   a  n  d  . 
              • NV bit image means a bit image which is defined in a non-volatile memory by FS q and printed by FS p. 
              • In standard mode, this command is effective only when processed at the   beginning of the line. 
              • In page mode, this command is not effective
              • This command is effective when 7 bytes <FS<yH> is processed as a normal value. 
              • When the amount of data exceeds the capacity left in the range defined by xL, xH, yL, yH, the printer processes xL, 
xH, yL, yH out of the defined range. 
              • In the first group of NV bit images, when any of the parameters xL, xH, yL, yH is out of the definition range, this comm-
and is disabled. 
             • In groups of NV bit images other than the first one, when the printer processes xL, xH, yL, yH out of the defined range, 
it stops processing this command and starts writing into the NV images. At this time, NV bit images that haven¡¯t been 
defined are disabled (undefined), but any NV bit images before that are enabled. 
             • The d indicates the definition data. In data (d) a 1 bit specifies a dot to be printed and a 0 bit specifies a dot not to be 
printed. 
             • This command defines n as the number of a NV bit image. Numbers rise in order from NV bit image 01H. Therefore, the 
first data group [xL xH yL yH d1...dk] is NV bit image 01H, and the last data group [xL xH yL yH d1...dk] is NV bit image n. 
The total agrees with the number of NV bit images specified by command FS p. 
              • A definition data of a NV bit image consists of [xL xH yL yH d1...dk]. Therefore, when only one NV bit image is defined 
n=1, the printer processes a data group [xL xH yL yH d1...dk] once. The printer uses ([data: (xL + xH × 256) ×(yL + yH × 
256) × 8] + [header :4])bytes of NV memory. 
              • The definition area in this printer is a maximum of 0.5M bits (64K bytes). This command can define several NV bit 
images, but cannot define a bit image data whose total capacity [bit image data + header] exceeds 0.5M bits (64K bytes). 
              • The printer is busy immediately before writing into NV memory. 
              • The printer does not transmit ASB status and perform status detection during processing of this command even when 
ASB is specified. 
              • When this command is received during macro definition, the printer ends macro definition, and begins performing this 
command. 
              • Once a NV bit image is defined, it is not erased by performing ESC @, reset, and power off. 
              • This command performs only definition of a NV bit image and does not perform printing.Printing of the NV bit image is 
performed by the FS p command. 
[Details] • Frequent write command execution may cause damage the NV memory. 
                Therefore, it is recommended to write the NV memory 10 times or less a day. 
              • The printer performs a hardware reset after the procedure to place the image into the NV memory. Therefore, user-

defined characters, downloaded bit images, and macros should be defined only after completing this command. The printer 
clears the receive and print buffers and resets the mode to the mode that was in effect at power on. At this time, DIP switch 
settings are checked again.

[Details] • This command is all characters (alphanumeric and Kanji) effective except for HRI characters. 
              • If n is outside of the defined range, this command is ignored.
              • In standard mode, the vertical direction is the paper feed direction, and the horizontal direction is perpendicular to the 
paper feed  direction. However, when character orientation changes in 90° clockwise-rotation mode, the relationship 
between vertical and horizontal directions is reversed. 
              • In page mode, vertical and horizontal directions are based on the character orientation. 
              • When characters are enlarged with different sizes on one line, all the characters on the line are aligned at the baseline.
The ESC ! command can also turn double-width and double-height modes on or off. However, the setting of the last 
received command is effective.

                The calculated result is truncated to the minimum value of the mechanical pitch. 
              • If the width set for the printing area is less than the width of one character, when the character data is developed, the 
                following processing is performed: 
                The printing area width is extended to the right to accommodate one character. 
                If the printing area width cannot be extended sufficiently, the left margin is reduced to accommodate one character. 
                If the printing area width cannot be extended sufficiently, the right space is reduced.

       ·This command ends with a NUL code. 
       · When the bar code system used is UPC-A or UPC-E, the printer prints the bar code data after receiving 12 bytes bar 
                code data and processes the following data as normal data. 
       · When the bar code system used is JAN13 (EAN13), the printer prints the bar code after receiving 13 bytes bar code 
                data and processes the following data as normal data. 
       · When the bar code system used is JAN8 (EAN8), the printer prints the bar code after receiving 8 bytes bar code data 
                 and processes the following data as normal data. 
       ·The number of data for ITF bar code must be even numbers. When an odd number of data is input, the printer ignores 
                the last received data. 
[Details for ②] 
       ·n indicates the number of bar code data, and the printer processes n bytes from the next character data as bar code 
                data. 
       ·If n is outside of the specified range, the printer stops command processing and processes the following data as 
                normal data. [Details in standard mode] .
       ·If d is outside of the specified range, the printer only feeds paper and processes the following data as normal data. 
       · If the horizontal size exceeds printing area, the printer only feeds the paper. 
       ·This command feeds as much paper as is required to print the bar code, regardless of the line spacing specified by 
                ESC 2 or ESC 3. 
       ·This command is enabled only when no data exists in the print buffer. When data exists in the print buffer, the printer 
                processes the data following m as normal data.     
       ·After printing bar code, this command sets the print position to the beginning of the line. 
       ·This command is not affected by print modes (emphasized, double-strike, underline, character size, white/black reve-
                 rse printing, or 90° rotated character, etc.), except for upside-down printing mode.
 [Details in page mode] 
       ·This command develops bar code data in the print buffer, but does not print it.  After processing bar code data, this 
                command moves the print position to the right side dot of the bar code. 
       · If d is out of the specified range, the printer stops command processing and processes the following data as normal 
                 data. In this case the data buffer position does not change. 
       · If bar code width exceeds the printing area, the printer does not print the bar code but moves the data buffer position 
                 to the left side out of the printing area.

GS v 0 m xL xH yL yH d1...dk
[Name]  Print raster bit image 
[Format] ASCII     GS    v     0    m   xL xH yL yH d1 ... dk 
     Hex        1D    76   30   m   xL xH yL yH d1 ... dk 
    Decimal  29   118  48   m   xL xH yL yH d1 ... dk 
[Range] 0 ≤ m ≤ 3, 48 ≤ m ≤ 51 
             0 ≤ xL ≤ 255 
             0 ≤ xH ≤ 255 
             0 ≤ yL ≤ 255 
             0 ≤ d ≤ 255 
              k = (xL + xH × 256) × (yL + yH × 256) (k ≠ 0) 
[Description] Selects Raster bit-image mode. The value of m selects the mode, as follows: 
       ·xL, xH, select the number of data bits ( xL+ xH×256) in the horizontal direction for the bit image.
       ·yL, yH, select the number of data bits ( yL+ yH×256) in the vertical direction for the bit image.
[Details] • In standard mode, this command is effective only when there is no data in the print buffer.
              • This command has no effect in all print modes (character size, emphasized, double-strike, upside-down, underline, 
                white/black reverse printing, etc.) for raster bit image.
              • If the printing area width set by GS L and GS W is less than the minimum width, the printing area is extended to the 
                minimum width only on the line in question. The minimum width means 1 dot in normal (m=0, 48) and double-height 
                (m=2, 50), 2 dots in double-width (m=1, 49) and quadruple (m=3, 51) modes.
              • Data outside the printing area is read in and discarded on a dot-by-dot basis.
              • The position at which subsequent characters are to be printed for raster bit image is specified by HT (Horizontal Tab), 
                ESC $ (Set absolute print position), ESC \ ( Set relative print position), and GS L (Set left margin ). If the position at 
                which subsequent characters are to be printed is not a multiple of 8, print speed may decline.
              • The ESC a (Select justification) setting is also effective on raster bit images.
              • When this command is received during macro definition, the printer ends macro definition, and begins performing this 
                command. The definition of this command should be cleared.
              • d indicates the bit-image data. Set time a bit to 1 prints a dot and setting it to 0 does not print a dot.

[Range] 0 ≤ n ≤ 255 
[Description] Sets the print mode for Kanji characters, using n as follows: 
[Details] • When both double-width and double-height modes are set (including right- and left-side character spacing), quadruple-
                size characters are printed. 
              • The printer can underline all characters (including right- and left-side character spacing), but cannot underline the 
                space set by HT and 90° clockwise-rotated characters. 
              • The thickness of the underline is that specified by FS , regardless of the character size. 
              • When some of the characters in a line are double or more height, all the characters on the line are aligned at the 
                baseline. 
              • It is possible to emphasize the Kanji character using FS W or GS !, the setting of the last received command is 
                effective. 
              • It is possible to turn under line mode on or off using FS , and the setting of the last received command is effective.

[Description] Sets left- and right-side Kanji character spacing n1 and n2, respectively. 
                    • When the printer model used supports GS P, the left-side character spacing is [n1 × horizontal or vertical motion 
                      units], and the right-side character spacing is [ n2 × horizontal or vertical motion units]. 
[Details] • When double-width mode is set, the left- and right-side character spacing is twice the normal value. 
              • The horizontal and vertical motion units are set by GS P. The previously specified character spacing does not change, 
                even if the horizontal or vertical motion unit is changed using GS P. 
              • The value cannot be less than the minimum horizontal movement amount, and must be in even units of the minimum 
                horizontal movement amount. 
              • In standard mode, the horizontal motion unit is used. 
              • In page mode, the horizontal or vertical motion unit differs in page mode, depending on starting position of the printable 
                area as follows:

[Description] • Turns quadruple-size mode on or off for Kanji characters. 
                     • When the LSB of n is 0, quadruple-size mode for Kanji characters is turned off. 
                     • When the LSB of n is 1, quadruple-size mode for Kanji characters is turned on. 
[Details] • Only the lowest bit of n is valid. 
              • In quadruple-size mode, the printer prints the same size characters as when double-width and double-height modes 
                are both turned on. 
              • When quadruple-size mode is turned off using this command, the following characters are printed in normal size. 
              • When some of the characters on a line are different in height, all the characters on the line are aligned at the baseline. 
              • FS ! or GS ! can also select and cancel quadruple-size mode by selecting double-height and double-width modes, and 
                the setting of the last received command is effective.

Appendix Y: print mode and its conversion
Y.1 Summary printer has two operating modes: standard mode and page mode. In standard mode , as long as the 
line printer buffer is full , or received
Print or feed command, the printer will print the paper in hand . In page mode , all of the print data and feed 
commands are in the specified memory space, the printer does not perform any operation is stored . Until it receives 
an ESC FF or FF command, the printer will print all the content areas are printed.
For example : When the printer is in standard mode received "ABCDEF" <LF>, it immediately "ABCDEF" to print out 
a line of paper in hand . In page mode , the printer will "ABCDEF" is written in memory of the print area, the next 
print data on the next line of the print area . ESC L command to switch the printer to the page mode , all data are 
processed after this in page mode . All data can thus execute ESC FF command received print out all the data , but 
can only execute FF command received print out, and the printer will switch to standard mode. ESC S command 
execution can also switch the printer to standard mode , but it does not print in page mode the received data, and 
these data will be cleared .

Switching Y.1 standard mode and page mode between
                Y. 2 set various values in standard mode and page mode
                   1 ) Some commands ( eg : ESC SP, ESC 2, ESC 3, and FS S) can be used both in standard mode and 
                      can be used in page mode , and their arguments are the same. However, provided in two modes are 
                        independent , they are stored , respectively .
                Y. 3 Set Print Area
                   1 ) print area is set by ESC W command. If the ESC W command before receiving all of the print and pa-
                       per feed operations have been completed , the printer to the left ( as you face the printer ) as the print 
                       area of the origin of coordinates (x0, y0). Width (dx dot ) extension of the rectangular printing area to 
                       the right in the x- direction ( perpendicular to the paper feed direction ) from the origin of coordinates 
                      (x0, y0); Height (dy point ) in the y direction ( paper feed direction ) . If you do not use ESC W set the 
                      print area , the print area using default values.
                    2 ) After the printer in the print area and the print area direction ( by the ESC T command set ) is set , 
                       the received print data will be arranged according to the position within the print area as shown in 
                       Figure B.2 , A point for the starting position of the print area this is a default value. ( When a character 
                       is printed , A point as the baseline ) print data downloaded bitmap or barcode data to its current posit-
                       ion as the lower left corner ( Figure B.3 in point B), aligned with the baseline.
                    3 ) Upon receiving a command containing feed (eg : Before LF or ESC J), if the print data ( including ch-
                         aracter spacing ) has exceeded the print area , the printer automatically feeds the line ( how much 
                         feed , determined by the ESC line-height 2 and ESC 3 settings ) , while the printing position to the 
                         next column header .
                    4 ) The default line height is 1/6 inch , equivalent to 31 points on the vertical . If the line containing the 
                         next print data in the longitudinal upscaling 2 times the characters, or bitmap occupies two lines or 
                         more lines , as well as higher than normal character code , the printer can not meet the needs of the 
                         feed volume , resulting in a character on a line of characters printed and the printed overlay. To avoid 
                         this, the line can be increased higher .
For example
            When printing a height of 6 bytes downloaded bitmap using the formula below :
            { Vertical dots (8 × 6) - printing area starting position feed point (24)} × vertical motion unit ( 200 /200 ) =24 ,  
            that is, to print the bitmap is complete , will require the print position based on the starting position of the 
            area down 24 points. With the following command :
            ESC W xL, xH, yL, yH, dxL, dxH, dyL, dyH ESC T n
            ESC 3 24 Å to set a new line of high-
            LF
            GS / 1
            ESC 2 Å The row height back to the 1/6 inches
